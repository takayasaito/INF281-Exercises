\question \textbf{Bit score}
  
BLAST reports bit scores, which are the information content that are calculated from raw scores.

\begin{itemize}
\item Bit score: $S' = \dfrac{(\lambda S - \ln⁡ K)}{\ln⁡ 2}$
\item S: raw score
\item K and $\lambda$: Karlin-Altschul statistics
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
x  & $\ln x$ \\ \hline
1 & 0 \\ \hline
2 & 0.693 \\ \hline
3 & 1.099 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Assume K: 3 and $\lambda$: 0.1 and use the table above to answer the following questions.

\begin{parts}

%% (a)
  \part What is the bit score when the raw score is 80.29?

\begin{solution}[0.75 in]
$\dfrac{0.1 \times 80.29 - 1.099}{0.693} = \dfrac{6.93}{0.693} = 10$
\end{solution}

%% (b)
\part $2^{S'}$ indicates the expected search space size that one can find an alignment with score at least S by chance alone. What is the $2^{S'}$ value when the raw score is 17.92?

\begin{solution}[0.75 in]
$S' = \dfrac{0.1 \times 17.92 - 1.099}{0.693} = \dfrac{0.693}{0.693} = 1;$ \quad $2^{1} = 2$
\end{solution}
