\question \textbf{Bit score to e-value}
  
The e-value represents the expected number of hits when homologous sequence are searched on a database of a particular size. It can be calculated from a bit score as follows. 
 
 $E = \dfrac{\mathrm{Size \, of \, search \, space}}{2^{\mathrm{bit-score}}}$

\begin{parts}

%% (a)
  \part What is the e-value when the size of search space is 3200 and the bit score is 4?

\begin{solution}[0.75 in]
$\dfrac{3200}{2^4} = \dfrac{3200}{16} = 200$
\end{solution}

%% (b)
\part Assume we can calculate a search space size as $m \times n$ where $m$ is the query sequence size and $n$ is the total character size of a database. What is the e-value when $m$ is 20, $n$ is 4000, and the bit score is 3?

\begin{solution}[0.75 in]
$\dfrac{20 \times 4000}{2^3} = \dfrac{80000}{8} = 10000$
\end{solution}
