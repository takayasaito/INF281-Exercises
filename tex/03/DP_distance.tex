\question \textbf{Sequence distance with DP}
DP can be used to calculate the edit distance (Levenshtein distance) between two sequences.

\medskip 

\textbf{Scoring scheme: }\\
\null \quad $R_{ab}$ = 0 for a = b \\ 
\null \quad $R_{ab}$ = -1 for a $\neq$ b \\ 
\null \quad $g = 1$

With the scoring scheme above, the edit distance d is calculated as $â€“1 * T$ where $T$ is the optimal score of the DP.

Find the edit distance between two sequences q = AG and d = ACG.
