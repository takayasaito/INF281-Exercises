\question \textbf{Maximum parsimony}

The maximum parsimony uses column-wise operations of union and intersection. The number of union operations is counted to find the tree that minimizes the evolutionary changes. \\

Use the first column of the MSA and also Tree A and B to answer the following questions.

\vspace{0.1 in}

\begin{parts}

%% (a)
  \part How many union operations are necessary to estimate the labels of the root and the internal nodes of Tree A?

\begin{solution}[0.35 in]
2
\end{solution}

%% (b)
  \part Estimate the labels of the root and the internal nodes of Tree B.

%% (c)
  \part How many union operations are necessary to estimate the root and the internal nodes of Tree B?
  
\begin{solution}[0.35 in]
1
\end{solution}

%% (d)
  \part  Which tree, Tree A or B, indicates less evolutionary changes when only the first column is considered?
  
\begin{solution}[0.35 in]
Tree B
\end{solution}
